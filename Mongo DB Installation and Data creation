Mongo DB Script ----

Step 1 - Installation for Mac

1. Download the .tgz file from "https://www.mongodb.org/downloads"

2. Open terminal and navigate to Downloads

3. sudo tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.2.5.tgz

4. mkdir -p mongodb

5. cp -R -n mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.2.5/ mongodb


Step 2 - Setting up permissions

1. Navigate to root - Execute "cd " (without the quotes)

2. vi .bash_profile

3.  Add this line: export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH 
	
	Replacing the  <mongodb-install-directory> with the path to the extracted MongoDB archive (the mongodb folder we created before)

4. Press ESC  and type ":wq!" without the quotes and hit Enter

5. mkdir -p /data/db

6. sudo chmod -R 777 /data/db

7. Go to root - Execute  "cd /" without the quotes

8. Execute <path to binary>/mongod
	
	<path to binary> is "<mongodb-install-directory>/bin"


-- YOU SHOULD SEE A "WAITING FOR CONNECTION" PROMPT AT THE LAST OF THE SCREEN. THIS MEANS THAT THE MONGO DB IS UP AND RUNNING.


NEXT STEPS

Step 3 - Creating Databases, and records

1. Open a new terminal and DO NOT close the previous terminal

2. Run <mongodb-install-directory>/bin/mongo

3. Create a database - Execute  "use test_db", where test_db is the database name.
	test successful creation of database by executing "db". This shall print the name of the database, in this case "test_db"

4. Create a collection - Collection is the equivalent of tables in Mongo
	db.createCollection("users")
	db.createCollection("equipment")
	db.createCollection("usageDetails")

5. insert documents - Documents are the equivalent of rows.
	db.users.insert({id: 01, objectType: "person", displayName: "Ricky"})
	db.users.insert({id: 02, objectType: "person", displayName: "Anne"})
	db.users.insert({id: 03, objectType: "person", displayName: "Rebecca"})
	db.users.insert({id: 04, objectType: "person", displayName: "Ankur"})

	db.equipment.insert ({id: 01, objectType: "equipment", displayName: "TreadMill"})

--AND WE ARE DONE

NOTE - In case you get an Incorrect syntax error or anything similar to that, make sure that all the quotes that
are used in the code are straight quotes, like this "", and not curved quotation marks as we usually write. This might happen if 
you copy and paste the above code into some text editor before trying to execute it.
